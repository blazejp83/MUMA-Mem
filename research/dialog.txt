This is essentially pre-loading context manually because the model can't hold persistent state across sessions. It's a filesystem-as-memory workaround.
The real problem isn't folder structure, it's that the agent has a finite context window, no native sense of salience, and no way to reason about what it doesn't currently see. You're trading context loss for context flooding and hoping the right file gets pulled at the right time.
It helps vs having nothing, but calling it 10x is generous. It's retrieval, not intelligence. The actual hard problem is routing, memory management, and scoping what the agent sees per task, not building a bigger filing cabinet.

Branko Miljesic custom built mcp bridge between agents, working out for me so far.

Nazmul Amin Ashiq MCP bridge at least solves for routing and context scoping between agents, which is wheree the real leverage is Would be curious what your handoff logic looks like between agents and how youre managing memory persistence across the bridge
