# Roadmap: MUMA-Mem

## Overview

Build a multi-user multi-agent memory system for OpenClaw in five phases: lay the storage and embedding foundation, implement the core write/read pipelines with semantic search, add cognitive-science-based activation and forgetting (the key differentiator), layer on multi-agent coordination with visibility controls, and finally add background intelligence with consolidation and CLI tooling.
